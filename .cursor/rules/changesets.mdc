This project uses Changesets for versioning and releases.

## When committing changes

Before making a commit that affects the library's functionality, create a changeset:

```bash
bun changeset
```

Then select the appropriate version bump:
- `patch` - Bug fixes, internal changes
- `minor` - New features (backwards compatible)
- `major` - Breaking changes

Include the generated `.changeset/*.md` file in your commit.

## When to include a changeset

**Include a changeset for:**
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Breaking changes
- API changes
- Behavior changes

**Skip changesets for:**
- Documentation-only changes
- CI/tooling changes
- Internal refactors with no user-facing impact
- Test-only changes

## Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run `bun changeset` and describe the change
3. Commit both code changes and the changeset file together
